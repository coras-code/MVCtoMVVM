# MCVtoMVVM

This project helps to see the differences between MVC and MVVM. Uses the ebird api and displays bird sightings in the UK. If there are more than 5 birds the cell accessory type and label changes 

**Branches:**
### Main 
This branch contains MVC and MVVM patterns, can switch between them by editing the app and scene delegate (comment and uncomment the desired patterm)

###  MVC
###  MVVM
These branches are the MVC and MVVM seperated out

### Original Code
This branch is the orginal code from the youtube tutorial I followed. (LINK)
It has both MVC and MVVM in the same project, *change the app and scene delegate to switch from between the two.*
Shows different programatic UI things I could look into.

###  MVC IB 
###  MVVM IB
At present I am more familiar with using interface bulider so converted the storyboard so that I could focus on the different design patterns 

### Improvements
The detail labels truncate, need to make the cells dynamic so the height changes. 
Dealing with the optional 'HowMany' from the api better
Hide api key
